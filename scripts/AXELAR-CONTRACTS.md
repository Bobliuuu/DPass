We tried creating our own interchain token, but ran into problems along the way. 

Our goal was to create a native interchain token hosted on Axelar that had a 1-1 mapping with JKL, then convert any Jackal tokens to our new interchain token, using EVM-20 and the Axelar cross chain protocol to then convert that to a standard chain like ETH or Sol. The reverse process would be similar.
